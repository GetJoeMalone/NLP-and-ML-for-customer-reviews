    "My buddy bought one of the Chinese bumpers off Amazon for only a couple dollars cheaper and it's not nearly as heavy duty or well built as this beast. Also, the powder coating on this is excellent and much better than the Chinese bumpers. My only complaint, and I emailed Fab Fours about this, is that they don't secure the winch plate to the bumper before shipping. It's a common problem mentioned on the forums as well. I had to repaint several areas of my brand new bumper because the winch plate scraped all the powder coating off. Rustoleum High Performance Enamel flat black is almost a perfect match so I'd suggest using that for your touch up. It's also much more durable than normal flat black spray paint. At this price point there's really no reason to not buy an American made quality product! It truly is a better bumper.\n",

    "I had already read some of the reviews, so I kind of had an idea I would get the Door and mirror armor with some paint damage. The packaging was ok for the door armor, but the mirror armor packaging was absolutely horrible! they were wrapped in some kind of thin cloth material in a large box, were they had obviously had a ruff trip. Tons of paint had chipped off and been scratched up, which is why they get the 3 stars. You're paying a lot for these products, so you would at least think they could spring for some decent way to protect the items during transport. Even the door armor had chipped paint, it had a small layer of Styrofoam material wrapped around them. Anyway, I had also purchased a few cans of Rhino lining with this order, just based on the reviews so not a big issue. It's a shame though, this could be 5/5 stars especially the craftsmanship is really awesome, just the packaging ruins the rating!\n",

    "Dislikes Fab fours could make this alot more user friendly by asking one simple question: what type of fog lights are you connected to? That ought to include purchasing options with the oem wiring harness for direct attachment. As of right right the end user must splice in new lines into existing and also add some resistors for the LED voltage, it needs stepped down. So have some electrical knowledge before installing. The directions are also lacking a few clear photos however if your a DIY person you should be fine deciphering the project. Also FYI this thing weighs like 250lbs, so some reduced fuel economy will be noticed. I lost 1 mpg on my range calculator.\n",

    "I have heard many complaints about permanently mounted winches. Weathering is a concern for sure. If you use a receiver mount you don't have to leave any accessory out in the weather. My winch sits in the covered bed of my truck until I want to use it. Plus the excellent strategy to be able to mount the winch in the rear receiver if needed. A front receiver also makes maneuvering a trailer into a tight spot much easier. Any accessory that mounts to a 2 inch receiver can be used in the rear or the front of the truck. I am very satisfied with this front hitch.\n",

    "My factory bumper on my 2015 Ram 1500 was damaged when I hit a semi tire tread at night. I ordered this one as it has the option to add a winch tray(Part No. K1200-1), D-Ring mount(Part No. M1850-1), high-flow lower guard(Part No. KGAIR-1), or lower light guard(Part No. KLITE-1 ). It looks similar to typical Ranch hand style bumpers, which are locally made to me. But the price, appearance, and clearance is what sold me on it. From my guessing this weighs about 150ish pounds, which is fine for a half ton truck without needing to add heady duty coils or spacers up front. If it was 200-250lb I'd want heavy duty front springs so I could add a winch without concern of the truck nose-diving when braking. The powdercoating, welds, seams, everything looks good. I'll update this if anything changes, and upload a photo or two.\n",

The packaging was ok for the door armor, but the mirror armor packaging was absolutely horrible! they were wrapped in some kind of thin cloth material in a large box, were they had obviously had a ruff trip. Tons of paint had chipped off and been scratched up, which is why they get the 3 stars. You're paying a lot for these products, so you would at least think they could spring for some decent way to protect the items during transport. Even the door armor had chipped paint, it had a small layer of Styrofoam material wrapped around them. Anyway, I had also purchased a few cans of Rhino lining with this order, just based on the reviews so not a big issue.

    "I was pleasantly surprised with the fit and finish of my bumper. It came packaged like a fort. I installed it by myself with the blocking. I also installed led backup lights by making just 2 brackets. It looks awesome and is a real bumper not just another body panel. Great job ! I had no problem installing the trailer plug as shown in the pictures. I also had no problem installing led 120w spot lights in the back of the bumper.\n",

    "First off, yes, this fits a 2018 Colorado ZR2. On the Fab Four website it says it won't fit the ZR2 package but it did. Although, it needed some custom work done to the spare tire lowering port for the plastic to fit. This bumper is really heavy duty and I know my back end is much more protected now. Plus it has the added steps as the stock ZR2 bumper doesn't have any because they would get sheared off when rock crawling but these are thick solid steel. Besides the extra work for the spare tire port the only other nitpick is the fact that it bulges out on the sides and it is flat which is a bad thing as far as aerodynamics are concerned. Although it is probably negligible it would have been nice to have had it angled even a little to improve air flow. Besides those two small complaints I like the bumper and I would recommend it if you want a good looking, protective, and functional bumper. Also, if you're wondering why this ZR2 is so clean it is because it just got a complimentary car wash, it is usually covered in mud.\n",

    "I cannot say enough good things about this bumper. It looks great and bolted right on according the shop installing it. While it does not repel every tailgater on the road, it clearly seems to discourage most. I bought this bumper, a grille guard, and winch tray to protect the back end and front end of my 2017 Colorado Diesel. My fuel economy is so far as I can tell unchanged and my piece of mind is greatly improved. My sole criticism is that the side steps, while very functional, are a little small. The GIANT step in the middle is AWESOME and provides me with even easier access to the truck bed than the side steps.\n",

    "Very heavy duty bumper that does bolt in without modification. Instructions were a little lacking though. I didn't like reinstalling the factory clamps that hold the spare tire lowering portal and ended up drilling and tapping the new bumper so I could use a machine screw to hold it in place. It all turned out well though. Fits good. Some slight damage to the paint/powder coat from shipping. One bent tab for the license plate light that easily bent back into place. Again overall very happy with the bumper.\n",

It is a HEAVY bumper. Shipping ticket said 204 lbs. 4 stars only because of the minor damage to the bumper.\n",

I had to prop one end up on a box to get the angle right to insert the first bolt on the opposite end. Also I found that it was necessary to install the first bolt in the second bracket first as it took a little finagling to get all the bolt holes to line up.)\n",

    "Install is fairly quick. I have the trail rail system- not required- but works with the rack perfectly. I also have the decked drawers and did not have to remove them for install. It sits pretty even on the bed rails. I did have to drill out the most rearward hole on side pieces of the trail rail because the hole was off from the thickness of rack mount. No big deal though. The lighting cut outs have the mount on side so no matter what light you use, it will be mounted side ways. I hate the rigid logo being vertical instead of horizontal but oh well. The d series scene lights fit great. I do wish it came with one more cross member(have to order for almost 70$ Each) for the top and that they had lined up holes for a 50” light bar on the front like their other roof racks. Nothing I tried lines up other than some SRQ rigid lights.\n",

Then since I live in Texas I had to order a license plate bracket that I had to modify because It mounts to the bottom of the bumper using the skid plate holes taking away all the ground clearance.

Tons of paint had chipped off and been scratched up, which is why they get the 3 stars. You're paying a lot for these products, so you would at least think they could spring for some decent way to protect the items during transport. Even the door armor had chipped paint, it had a small layer of Styrofoam material wrapped around them. Anyway, I had also purchased a few cans of Rhino lining with this order, just based on the reviews so not a big issue.

    "Fit my 2020 Gladiator perfectly. Was easy to install overall, just the main bolts. Looks flippin amazing on the Jeep. Fog lights were a little tricky to install but not bad. My only complaint is that there were a couple bad rubs in the powder coat from shipping, not that I expect the bumper to remain perfect but I would rather be the one to put the rubs there on my own and not brand new out of the box.\n",

    "Dislikes Fab fours could make this alot more user friendly by asking one simple question: what type of fog lights are you connected to? That ought to include purchasing options with the oem wiring harness for direct attachment. As of right right the end user must splice in new lines into existing and also add some resistors for the LED voltage, it needs stepped down. So have some electrical knowledge before installing. The directions are also lacking a few clear photos however if your a DIY person you should be fine deciphering the project. Also FYI this thing weighs like 250lbs, so some reduced fuel economy will be noticed. I lost 1 mpg on my range calculator.\n",

    "I have heard many complaints about permanently mounted winches. Weathering is a concern for sure. If you use a receiver mount you don't have to leave any accessory out in the weather. My winch sits in the covered bed of my truck until I want to use it. Plus the excellent strategy to be able to mount the winch in the rear receiver if needed. A front receiver also makes maneuvering a trailer into a tight spot much easier. Any accessory that mounts to a 2 inch receiver can be used in the rear or the front of the truck. I am very satisfied with this front hitch.\n",

    "My factory bumper on my 2015 Ram 1500 was damaged when I hit a semi tire tread at night. I ordered this one as it has the option to add a winch tray(Part No. K1200-1), D-Ring mount(Part No. M1850-1), high-flow lower guard(Part No. KGAIR-1), or lower light guard(Part No. KLITE-1 ). It looks similar to typical Ranch hand style bumpers, which are locally made to me. But the price, appearance, and clearance is what sold me on it. From my guessing this weighs about 150ish pounds, which is fine for a half ton truck without needing to add heady duty coils or spacers up front. If it was 200-250lb I'd want heavy duty front springs so I could add a winch without concern of the truck nose-diving when braking. The powdercoating, welds, seams, everything looks good. I'll update this if anything changes, and upload a photo or two.\n",

    "I had already read some of the reviews, so I kind of had an idea I would get the Door and mirror armor with some paint damage. The packaging was ok for the door armor, but the mirror armor packaging was absolutely horrible! they were wrapped in some kind of thin cloth material in a large box, were they had obviously had a ruff trip. Tons of paint had chipped off and been scratched up, which is why they get the 3 stars. You're paying a lot for these products, so you would at least think they could spring for some decent way to protect the items during transport. Even the door armor had chipped paint, it had a small layer of Styrofoam material wrapped around them. Anyway, I had also purchased a few cans of Rhino lining with this order, just based on the reviews so not a big issue. It's a shame though, this could be 5/5 stars especially the craftsmanship is really awesome, just the packaging ruins the rating!\n",

    "Verified Purchase\n",
    "First off, yes, this fits a 2018 Colorado ZR2. On the Fab Four website it says it won't fit the ZR2 package but it did. Although, it needed some custom work done to the spare tire lowering port for the plastic to fit. This bumper is really heavy duty and I know my back end is much more protected now. Plus it has the added steps as the stock ZR2 bumper doesn't have any because they would get sheared off when rock crawling but these are thick solid steel. Besides the extra work for the spare tire port the only other nitpick is the fact that it bulges out on the sides and it is flat which is a bad thing as far as aerodynamics are concerned. Although it is probably negligible it would have been nice to have had it angled even a little to improve air flow. Besides those two small complaints I like the bumper and I would recommend it if you want a good looking, protective, and functional bumper. Also, if you're wondering why this ZR2 is so clean it is because it just got a complimentary car wash, it is usually covered in mud.\n",

    "I cannot say enough good things about this bumper. It looks great and bolted right on according the shop installing it. While it does not repel every tailgater on the road, it clearly seems to discourage most. I bought this bumper, a grille guard, and winch tray to protect the back end and front end of my 2017 Colorado Diesel. My fuel economy is so far as I can tell unchanged and my piece of mind is greatly improved. My sole criticism is that the side steps, while very functional, are a little small. The GIANT step in the middle is AWESOME and provides me with even easier access to the truck bed than the side steps.\n",

I didn't like reinstalling the factory clamps that hold the spare tire lowering portal and ended up drilling and tapping the new bumper so I could use a machine screw to hold it in place. It all turned out well though. Fits good. Some slight damage to the paint/powder coat from shipping. One bent tab for the license plate light that easily bent back into place. Again overall very happy with the bumper.\n",

I had to prop one end up on a box to get the angle right to insert the first bolt on the opposite end. Also I found that it was necessary to install the first bolt in the second bracket first as it took a little finagling to get all the bolt holes to line up.)\n",

It sits pretty even on the bed rails. I did have to drill out the most rearward hole on side pieces of the trail rail because the hole was off from the thickness of rack mount. No big deal though. The lighting cut outs have the mount on side so no matter what light you use, it will be mounted side ways. I hate the rigid logo being vertical instead of horizontal but oh well. The d series scene lights fit great. I do wish it came with one more cross member(have to order for almost 70$ Each) for the top and that they had lined up holes for a 50” light bar on the front like their other roof racks. Nothing I tried lines up other than some SRQ rigid lights.\n",

    "The last custom bumper I had was a different brand, this one is not as heavy, I believe it isn't as tough...Looks great, functions great, but I'm a little worried to use it as I did the other brand...I pushed a lot with the old one...gates, round bales, trees, even a few field stones. I'm sure as the newness wares off, all abuse this one too, we'll see how it holds up.\n",

    "Overall I like the bumper, it fits very well to the truck. The only thing I’m skeptical about is the thickness of the metal and the instructions that were sent with it don’t go too into detail about installing the bumper. Also it most definitely does not weigh 300 pounds so if you have some meat on your bones you shouldn’t have any problem picking it up to install it\n",

Then since I live in Texas I had to order a license plate bracket that I had to modify because It mounts to the bottom of the bumper using the skid plate holes taking away all the ground clearance.
