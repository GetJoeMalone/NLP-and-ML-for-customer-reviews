The goal with this project was to scrape user reviews from Amazon for Fab Fours products, then use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to prepare the data for models. 

We used a linear classification model to predict the rating of a review. 

# Analysis
* Over 60% of reviews were 5 stars.
* Only 3 customers left reviews on 2 or more products
